i loved this pattern to explore

so what i have understood, basically if you have complex class(product we can say) to build, then instead of taking all the things inside constructor, build it sequentially or make it decouple cause sometimes we may not need all the things. right? so this builder pattern is useful when you have so many thing to build within a class, i mean to say we will get the vibe of building(connecting the dots) or orchestrating some thing. its intersting and fun.

Through out my implementation you will get factory pattern as well, so much fun in one implementation. Beautiful!!!!!!
